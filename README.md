# bookbot
BookBot is my first project!

## How it works?

This Program helps you to generate a Report over the amount of words in a book plus a breakdown on how often each Letter is used.  
  
**To use this program you need to have your book in a txt format.**  
  
1. Download the program
2. Adjust main function `print_report("<Path_to_your_Book>")`
3. Execute the main.py via terminal `python3 main.py`

## Example report Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
